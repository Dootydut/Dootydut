- Howdy, You can call me Doot.
- I love to develop games! Mostly horror, I like to call myself a "Horror producer and consumer."
- I'm learning to advance my skills in Godot, Which is the main engine I use.
- If you are looking to collaborate, I'm sorry to say that I don't plan on developing any group projects.
